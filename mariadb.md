Hereâ€™s a structured list of **MariaDB Administration & Management Topics** you can use as a roadmap or reference for database learning and operations:

---

## ðŸ”¹ MariaDB Administration & Management Topics

### 1. **Introduction to MariaDB**

* What is MariaDB (history, relation to MySQL)
* Use cases: OLTP, web applications, analytics
* MariaDB architecture overview (clients, server, storage engines)

---

### 2. **Installation & Setup**

* Installing MariaDB (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS, source)
* Initial configuration (`my.cnf`)
* Running MariaDB as a service (`systemctl`, `service`)
* Securing installation (`mysql_secure_installation`)

---

### 3. **User & Access Management**

* Creating users and assigning passwords
* GRANT and REVOKE privileges
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Authentication plugins (PAM, LDAP, socket)
* Password policies (expiry, strength, rotation)

---

### 4. **Database & Schema Management**

* Creating and dropping databases
* Managing tables (create, alter, drop)
* Data types and constraints
* Views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, events

---

### 5. **Storage Engines**

* Default storage engines (InnoDB, Aria)
* MyISAM vs InnoDB differences
* Choosing the right storage engine
* Engine-specific tuning options

---

### 6. **Configuration Management**

* MariaDB configuration file locations (`/etc/mysql/my.cnf`, `/etc/my.cnf.d/`)
* Important parameters: buffer pool, cache, max connections, query cache
* Performance tuning with `mysqltuner`
* Dynamic vs static configuration changes

---

### 7. **Backup & Restore**

* Logical backups (`mysqldump`, `mariadb-dump`)
* Physical backups (file copy, Percona XtraBackup, Mariabackup)
* Point-in-time recovery with binary logs
* Automating scheduled backups

---

### 8. **Replication & Clustering**

* Master-Slave replication
* Semi-synchronous replication
* Multi-source replication
* MariaDB Galera Cluster (multi-master synchronous replication)
* Monitoring and troubleshooting replication

---

### 9. **Security Management**

* Securing MariaDB with firewalls (bind-address, TLS/SSL)
* Encryption at rest and in transit
* Preventing SQL injection (application-level)
* User privilege audits
* Security best practices

---

### 10. **Performance Monitoring & Optimization**

* Query performance analysis (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`)
* Slow query log
* Index management (BTREE, FULLTEXT, HASH)
* Buffer pool and cache optimization
* Locking and transaction isolation levels
* Optimizing joins and subqueries

---

### 11. **High Availability & Scalability**

* Load balancing with ProxySQL or MaxScale
* Failover strategies (automatic/manual)
* Sharding basics in MariaDB
* Replication + clustering for scalability

---

### 12. **Logging & Monitoring**

* Error log, general query log, slow query log
* Performance Schema / Information Schema
* Monitoring tools (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, Grafana, Percona Monitoring)

---

### 13. **Maintenance & Troubleshooting**

* Checking server status (`SHOW STATUS`, `SHOW PROCESSLIST`)
* Repairing corrupted tables (`CHECK TABLE`, `REPAIR TABLE`)
* Managing disk space (table optimization, archiving)
* Common errors (authentication, replication lag, lock contention)

---

### 14. **Advanced Topics**

* Partitioning tables
* Virtual columns and JSON support
* Window functions and CTEs
* Full-text search
* MariaDB plugins and extensions
* Migrating from MySQL to MariaDB

---

### 15. **Best Practices**

* Principle of least privilege for users
* Regular backups and restore testing
* Monitor slow queries and optimize
* Use InnoDB as default storage engine
* Keep MariaDB updated with security patches
